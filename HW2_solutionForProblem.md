 1. (2%) Implement 2 models with approximately the same number of  parameters, (A) one narrower and deeper (e.g. hidden_layers=6, hidden_dim=1024) and (B) the other wider and shallower (e.g. hidden_layers=2, hidden_dim=1700). Report training/validation accuracies for both models.
- narrower and deeper: Train Acc: 0.718887 | Val Acc: 0.676508 --> acc 0.677
- wider and shallower: Train Acc: 0.735853 | Val Acc: 0.684526 --> acc 0.685
 2. (2%) Add dropout layers, and report training/validation accuracies with dropout rates equal to (A) 0.25/(B) 0.5/(C) 0.75 respectively.
